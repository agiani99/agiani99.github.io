# My Favorite Coffee Brewing Methods

There are many ways to brew coffee, each resulting in different flavors and experiences. Here are some of my favorite methods:

## Pour Over (V60)

The Hario V60 is my go-to method for single cups of coffee. I love the clean, bright flavors it produces.

## AeroPress

The AeroPress is incredibly versatile and perfect for travel. It makes a concentrated coffee similar to espresso but with its own unique character.

## French Press

When I want a full-bodied, rich cup, the French Press never disappoints. The metal filter allows oils and fine particles to remain in the cup, creating a robust flavor.
