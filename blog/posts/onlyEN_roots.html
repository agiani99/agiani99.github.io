        <h3>Happy to sip with you a coffee on this .... but leave if it does not resonate</h3>

        <p>Long time, no see, friends. Some thoughts which I might not survive, if somebody makes a mistake or stays too much in their ego.</p>
		<blockquote>
          <p><em>All things with roots are not from us. They are already there. We need to take care of them, mimic them, eat them, conserve them, love them. We have generated only arms. We throw them each other as they have no roots. They are not from earth.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
		<p>This time I won't cite anyone. He is an unknown Professor of Italian Literature at Univery of Warsaw. I was reading these lines just these days and found them amazing. Rooted things. Real things. The ones I searched for every single days of my life. Genes, proteins, cells are there since amazing amount of years. Since when evolution found its way in the reality and rooted them "in". It is always a sewing, which generates roots. And roots generate something else. Vital. So is LIFE. We find them always already prepared. Already there to be discovered. There is no better job on earth: scientist. And being a synthetic chemist, a medicinal one, I asked myself: what the hell did you produce in all these years? Molecules? <strong>Novel molecules</strong> to be patented?.... ahahah! Ridicolous.</p>
		<p>There has been startups born with the mission to exchange a Carbon atom for a Silicon atom within known drugs. Novel Molecules, yes! For patent purposes. Has anyone ever thought that what we think are novel molecules, have probably already been generated and excluded by nature during billion of years? Yes, probably now they might be of help, but probably some more potent where there already for thousands years before to disappear, just because they had no producers anymore or need or utility. Everything comes from roots at the perfect time that evolution calls.</p>

		<p>We are always producing un-rooted things because we are so fast in disappearing. Some remain, though: Pyramids? Pergamon's Altar? Words, probably: Bible? Luwian Hieroglyphs? Sumerians and Akkadians Hieroglyphs? Cultural rests. Rooted? What is a root for a man/woman? Family? Ancestors? How far back? Language? Now the bombs destroyed roots and strange excavations. Does everything need to end in smoke? Dead smoke? Instead of asking where are you from? Which roots do you have? Show me, let me see. I am curious. We often stay silent, ghosting unknown people which "disturb" us. Even, or properly because, they <strong>show their roots to us freely, without shame.</strong>....Roots: the only things may survive our bombing arrogancy.</p>
