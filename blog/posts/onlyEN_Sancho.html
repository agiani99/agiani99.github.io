        <h1>Sancho's Version</h1>
        <p class="date">June 11, 2025</p>
        
        <h3>Happy to sip with you a coffee on this .... but leave if it does not resonate</h3>

        <p>Long time, no see, friends. Yesterday I stumbled on a diamond-cut sentence taken from Don Quixote:</p>
		<blockquote>
          <p><em>We fight against three giants, my dear Sancho: unjustice, fear and ignorance.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
		<p>Something that anyone of us at least once in a lifetime has experienced. Sometimes as kids already in school or with friends. Or as adults, in work environments or clubs. We are not talking here of theory: it is common sense. What attracted me, though, was how subtly interdependent these three evil feelings or situations are. Kids feel them as one, adults tend to dissect them, but in time/space (3D) they can be heavily subsequent and modulating each other.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<img src="Sancho.png" alt="Sancho's cycle">
			<p>There is a series of events that generate others? Any of the three that comes first and sparks others? I am not sure. However, some can be casual and linked to the today 3D situation, while other are so carved in our 5D that we tend to repeat them unknowingly just because we don't know how to face them from youth or even before. A kid learns how parents react; they assume it is right and fix the reaction in them and 3D situations modify your internal 5D objects.</p>
			<p>I am not thinking about ignorance here because it takes time to be built: the constant fear of unknown generates ignorance in long run. I am not speaking so much about unjustice, as it yes can show up in a sudden reaction, but it can be fixed suddenly as well. I am speaking about <strong>fear</strong>. We think that fear is irrational: but it has been demonstrated that it sits in amigdala, the deepest department in our brain and dictates emotional intelligence, so there is nothing irrational in it. It manages the way we defende ourselves from offenses. It shuts down logic when life is more important than anything else. It tells the body to react faster than any thoughts in order to escape dangers. This is what is amigdala for. It uses fear as propellent. It learns what to fear and what not. It is a long long established circuit, which <strong>now is triggered by both unjustice and ignorance.</strong></p>
			
			<p>Who manage unjustice and ignorance drive our fears. And this is exactly what autocrates, terrorists, plutocrates and like are doing to world, right now.<strong> But not only them, it can very closer to us with rampant managers, ghosting "friends" or colleagues, gossips. When truth disappears, this happens.</strong> When stupidity becomes aggressive, fear raises. Without logic reasons. When we accept shutted-down amigdalas to win, we regress to animals, but not innocently. In my opinion, this is the last evil attack to reason, to humanity, before final stage. Bring them to behave like animals through unjustice, ignorance and fear, then you can shot them down.</p>
			
			<p> A final quote from <a href:'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennio_Flaiano'>Ennio Flaiano</a>, someone who wrote Fellini's movies
			<blockquote>
				<p><em>‘Stupidity has made enormous progress. It is a sun that can no longer be stared at. Thanks to the media, it is no longer even the same, it feeds on other myths, it sells itself a lot, it has ridiculed common sense, it spreads terror around itself.’</em></p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>An example? Watch <a href:"https://www.netflix.com/de-en/title/81774713">STRAW movie</a></p>
