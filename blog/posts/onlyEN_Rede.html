        <h3>Happy to sip with you a coffee on this .... but leave if it does not resonate</h3>

        <p>Good morning! I rediscovered something I thought I had completely destroyed after my decision to not organise any farewell party after my retirement's day on March 31st 2025. I had long thought to summarize my 40+ years of work in some thoughts. If you think it is worth reading, here it is now in my personal blog:</p>
		
		<p>I stumbled few months ago into Francesco Petrarca, an Italian poet of 13th century, who wrote:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><em>Simul retroque prospiciens - At same time looking forward and backward</em></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>So we are as humans, so we need to be, as scientists. Think well about it: a very nice repurposing activities description. We are in front of both sides, past and future, as we look into them. As if it said: <strong>only present counts. Here and now.</strong> </p>
		<p>Looking back: in 1998 my personal, social and professional life exploded with a big bang and since then, for the good and the bad, working environments have always been like a family for me. I know, this is a damn dangerous thing. Few know my personal story, and I don't want to bother, but I know, this attitude to mix life and job, it was and still looks like an error, a heavy burden. Not much other invitees here. With my attempts to meet other people I had no luck .... Somebody here knows it. <strong>So you guys have been always like a real family to me.</strong> This fact, I suspect, is outside most common sense. Right? But not only bad things happened in my life: also unbearable wonderful things. Examples? Somebody disclosed to me amazing yet very painful parts of his life and someone of you hugged me in the corridor last may 2024 with no apparenty reason. </p>
		<p><strong>How could my need be so desperately evident in that moment</strong>, it is to me still a mystery and a question. I have received no answer so far, but so much I have received from you guys. You can't know.</p>
		<p>Now, present is all it counts. For us in pharma research, making space to truth in the present should be the only thing that counts, now. Can this quest for truth be a real burden? I suspect it is, YES, at least for PhD work: Kim, I thought about you here... ahah. Think about this, though ... <strong>in this struggle no one is closer to us than artists</strong>. Creative People, think well. <strong>There are only two kinds of people in our society who are REQUESTED to be, yes, not only consistent, but consistently creative!!</strong> Think about the consequences of this (USA administration gave us lately a real vivid demonstration). <strong>If art is really close to science: where should we position SCRUM masters!? Anyone?</strong> I don't deny consistent planning, make no mistake, Michelangelo spent in Sistine Chapel four years just for altar painting. No one denies planning was needed to Stonehenge or Pyramids efforts. However, we don't do things repetitevely like machines. I will always fight this idea to link research productivity to some tools. In Eli Lilly we had a motto: <strong>"Do it and then beg for excuse"</strong>.</p>
		<p>However, truth hides itslef in the details. Every sprint is different. Like every concert. From metal to jazz. I think artists have the same burden than us. Ask Reagon, for instance .... he does both.... ahah.</p><p>The real burden come from our organizations that, with their funds, allow us to keep on rolling: RESULTS, GRANT PROPOSALS, PAPERS, REWARDS .... forgot one: yes Nina, MONEY. For not to speak of overheads, you have it: the amazing Fraunhofer Expense Report. </p>
		<p>Never deny past evidencies you met, past performances, past errors. Never deny present evidencies, present achievements, even if small. And never deny your intuitions, your visions. Be creative everyday? and being requested to be so? <strong>Talk with your kids about your work</strong> ... and we will have immediately more scientists. I don't have a partner, so <strong>the only people I got visions from</strong> were you like artists and as researchers. Visions come from intuitions.</p>
		<p><strong>But, what is an intuition?</strong> May we call an unexpected future evidence? To me, it is a crack in reality matrix we look through (cit Leonhard Cohen's Anthem song). Future evidence!? It is the way Truth communicates with us; its way to pull our eyes to her. A mathematical attractor. A magnet. <strong>Is there anything more rewarding than this? Finding a small scientific truth.</strong> Truth among humans illuminates, shows novel possibilities. I am deeply convinced that our stomach, gut, brain, heart, bones feel at home in the truth. Truth is free, comes to us freely, unexpected, but sometimes long awaited and paid, costly paid, expensively paid. It comes from everywhere in the past, infomrs everything in the present and creates future.</p>
		<p><strong>THUS</strong>: keep on following truth, keep on being a researcher, a true researcher. Please.  And for what? Money? Rewards? Capitalism cannot be the last word. <strong>If it were, then this should be the best world possible</strong>: can you imagine?</p>
		<p>Truth can come from darkness: yes, like anyone of us when is newly met. <strong>From which unknonwn darkness are your from?</strong> In Italy we say this: don't judge anyone, as you don't know which darkness he/she is from... <strong>Truth is always beyond impossible</strong>. Have th ecourage to say "I don't know", but never block a student's quest for truth.</p><p> Enough for theory and faith.</p>
		<p>You will always find people who do things and some who show things. <strong>We have just to decide who to trust more.</strong> I loved to bring on the machine by being a backend man. I thank all backend colleagues I met in 40+ years. I have still contacts with most of them. Not so much with the others. It has been an honor to have dirty hands with you, guys. Petrarca, again, said: </p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><em>Ogni cosa bella passa e non dura - Every nice thing goes and doesn't last.</em></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p> Here in my heart, I know what to stuck to and what not. Now a last wish for you guys: I will use again the words of an Italian contemporary poetress, Mariangela Gualtieri:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p><em>Che si colmi la distanza tra cio' che senti e cio' che fai - Let the distance between what you feel and what you do, be filled.</em></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Another last citations from a movie I loved so much, "The Perfect Storm": Queen, Maria, Phil, Ole, Carsten, Jeanette, Markus, Reagon, Yojana, Johanna, Bernhard, Kim, Tanja, Katja, Nina, Mira and all. <strong>There is no goodbye, only love. Sleep well. Good night.</strong></p>
