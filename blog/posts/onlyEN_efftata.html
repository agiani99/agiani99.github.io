        <h3>Happy to sip with you a coffee on this .... but leave if it does not resonate</h3>

        <p>Good morning! Few days to think and to deliver. My new hobby you will <a href="https://www.github.com/agiani99">find here:</a> Happy to be back with you. Today I'd like to talk about how to be correctly <strong>secular</strong> in our days.</p>
		<p>If you asked to ChatGPT to deliver you the <strong>top 10 themes which most differentiate secular from religious attitude</strong>, today it will come out with these themes:</p>
		<p><table style="border:1px solid black;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
			<th>Laic (Secular)</th>
			<th>Religious</th>
			<tr><td>Rationalism & Empiricism</td><td>Faith & Revelation</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Separation of Church & State</td><td>Integration of Faith & Life</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Individual Autonomy</td><td>Community & Tradition</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Moral Relativism</td><td>Absolute Moral Codes</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Scientific Worldview</td><td>Spiritual/Transcendent Worldview</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Human Rights as Supreme Value</td><td>Divine Commandments</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Pluralism & Tolerance</td><td>Orthodoxy & Doctrine</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Focus on This-World Solutions</td><td>Focus on Afterlife/Salvation</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Progress & Change</td><td>Preservation of Tradition</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Critical Inquiry</td><td>Acceptance of Mystery</td></tr>
			</table>
		</p>
		<p> Intriguing, isn't it? It looks like that the vast statistical majority of concepts, which AI tools are based on, converge to assign to religion either legal concepts, or traditional ones, or historical ones (eg orthodoxy). Of course <strong>FAITH is coming out first</strong>: did we not expect it? But <strong>Mistery is relegated in position 10th!!!</strong> Amazing, uh?</p>
		<p> Imagine now a kid playing with his/her phone and, by chance, asking about religion. What will he/she get by AI? The statistical and potent message is clear: Modern Humans can only be secular, under no ethical laws coming from outside of us, not complaint to science, or intolerant, or irrealistic (do you remember 3D vs 5D?), or close to progress and changes or uncritical to any position.....</p>
		<p> NOW, I am asking you, parents of this kid, what would you correct in this view? <strong>Would you add or remove something from this perception</strong> forming in your kid's mind?</p>
		>p> In my humble opinion (imho, ahahah) there are at least two things to underline here:</p>
		<p><h3><strong>One</strong></h3></p>
		<p> I would remind the kid that we are in spacetime: thus <strong>this mindset</strong>, so statistical pervasive and potent, <strong>will also be corrected in the future, like all we had.</strong> This does not necessarily imply not to trust majorities. Be skeptical to the bitter end, no! On the contrary, this would mean to <strong>stay open to surprises</strong>, to live with open eyes, to search for unseen, unknown, unexperienced! <strong>Don't let majority think for you.</strong> Don't think that if you read knowledge from AI, you possess this knowledge. <strong>Experiences are key in lives.</strong> No knowledge comes from solitary sofas, but from walking, meeting, communicating, being in relationships, and hence from "SUFFER", from being "exposed". A provocation: Is this an effect of Spirit action on us? Opla' Mistery is coming out BIG again! By Faith, sure, so what?</p>
		<p><h3><strong>Two</strong></h3></p>
		<p> I would recollect <a href="https://agiani99.github.io/blog/posts/multilingual_Reassuring.html">my first blog</a> with Calasso's words about Homo saecularis:
		<blockquote>
          <p><em>Homo saecularis is not against religions per se. Religions are very much like ideologies - and he is used to deal with them every day. Those who say they are Christians must not be very different from those who say they are vegetarians. They are all groups, communities, fraternities. One can be a communist - as well as culturist. Every choice must be respected. They are all minorities. Niches. <strong>What Homo saecularis cannot grasp is the divine. He cannot situate or locate it. It is not part of the order of things. Of his things</strong>.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
		<p> So my second point for the kid would be: "Do you really want to become a human being who wants to relegate mistery in the cellar? Would not this attitude, in the long run, disconnect you from your most intimate 5D? Would this not finally betray point ONE?" Stay positive and TRUST life!!! Which life? The one you have now. Treat well your body and soul.</p>
		
		<p>Happy to sip with you a coffee on this .... more to come.</p>
