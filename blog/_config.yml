# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values

# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi Everyone. I am a retired scientist willing to share some thoughts with you guys.
  I don't pretend to solve or help to solve any problem. Just give you an out-of-box view of daily things.
  Just comment with a coffee mug (or espresso tiny ding) in my hand like I did for years (even during COVID)
  among colleagues quite everything happening around us and, why not, within us or within our faiths.
  Ready to see things differently. I will try my best, so I hope from you.
